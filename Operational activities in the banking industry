Brief on Banking Functions

Banking functions may be broadly classified into deposit, credit, and loan processing functions. 
Optimizing and streamlining core banking operations provides huge cost and time savings. 
A good understanding of the banking process flow is essential to decide on automation for banking. 
Given below is a brief introduction to the main banking functions.

Customer onboarding: A smooth and quick customer onboarding process wins the trust and loyalty of the customer. 
Legacy banking institutions depend on manual methods for gathering and verifying customer information. 
Modernized banks gather customer information through websites, mobile, and third-party platforms. 
Know your customer (KYC) verification is an important/mandatory part of the customer onboarding process. 
Owing to the rise in online frauds and financial terrorism, banks have made the KYC process mandatory. 
Anti-money laundering checks are also mandatory in customer onboarding. 
Gathering and verifying customer data from multiple sources can be cumbersome and error-prone when done through manual banking.

Loan processing: Loan processing is an exhaustive process with several important steps from loan origination to disbursement. 
Legacy banking systems process loans manually, which entails tons of paperwork, inordinate delays in approvals and verification, 
unexplained bottlenecks, increased scope for fraud, and multiple rejections and re-application. 
Modern banks need to have speedy and efficient loan processing systems that can handle huge volumes of loan originations across multiple platforms.

Credit card processing: Credit and debit card processing is an expansive process that requires accurate capture of data across multiple banking channels
and real-time updation of bank records. When done manually, credit card processing not only takes time and effort but is also prone to errors and inconsistencies. 
Automated credit and debit card processing cuts down significantly on the cost and time of processing and ensures 100% accuracy.

Core Banking Operations: Core banking operations make up all the back-end updates in the banking industry. 
These processes include customer data updates, KYC validations, accounting reconciliations, and overdraft protection. 
Speed and accuracy are paramount for core banking operations. Manual updates cannot provide the accuracy and speed required in core banking operations. 
Automated processing, especially robotic process automation (RPA), can increase the accuracy and speed of core banking operations.

Risk and compliance: Banks and financial institutions need to adhere to several policies and regulations. 
Updates on financial regulations and the creation of new policies is a routine feature in the banking and financial industry. 
Risk and compliance management is an important function in banking. Banks and financial institutions need to be audit-ready at all times by updating their data and policies. 
Anti-money laundering and fraud checks, KYC verification, and compliance checks can be effectively done through automation.
